## Hi there!👋 I'm Alan
## About Me

I'm a Junior Software Developer focused on building structured application systems using **C# and Unity**, as well as responsive interfaces using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

I design and implement logic-driven systems including authentication flows, session management, state-based workflows, and business logic simulations.  
I enjoy solving real problems, thinking about clean architecture, and continuously improving the quality of my code.
